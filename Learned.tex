\section*{Everything I've Learned}
This is a total comprehensive list of all the topics that I have learned. Individual files on these topics can be found in certain categories, which I will keep up-to-date in this document. Topics are not excluded to Software Engineering Principles, although most of them probably will be. Instead, I think I want to keep a comprehensive list of topics that I've learned, since I would like to look back on things and see how far I've come in all topics of life, and not just this software engineering path.
