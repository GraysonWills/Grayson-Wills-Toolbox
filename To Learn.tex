\section*{To Learn}
This is a total of all the concepts that I want/have yet to learn. I will try to keep them in a queue like fashion, although it won't be the easiest thing in the world to do... the adjustments of how quickly I want to learn things and the order will constantly be changing and can be up in the air any given month. But, it certainly doesn't hurt to try, and I think this will be a good exercise in keeping my thoughts organized and increasing my markdown/keyboard shortcut comprehension.
