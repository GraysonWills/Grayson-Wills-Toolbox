\section{Notes}
The solution that i provide runs and beats 100 percent of all other tests, which is a miracle in it of itself seemingly. I loop over both lists, and then create a new solution head

The recommended solution creates no new variables at all! Which is astounding to me to say the least. But, it makes a lot of sense... you go node by node, hold onto the carry, and then transfer it over, and if there is no longer a matching length, or one number is longer than the other, you just carry on adding to the solution, nothing else required.

Reminds me that I have a long way to go when it comes to preparation for any sort of real coding, and how rusty I am when it comes to this stuff. I'll figure it out eventually though. Just got to get back into the game!
